            liable for the defamatory, offensive, or illegal conduct of Users or
            third parties. Additionally, in no event will the Company be liable
            for any special, indirect, incidental, punitive, or consequential
            damages, including, without limitation, any loss of use, loss of
            profits, loss of data, cost of procurement of substitute products or
            services, or any other such damages, howsoever caused, and on any
            theory of liability, whether for breach of contract, tort (including

            of any limited remedy. You acknowledge and understand that the
            disclaimers, exclusions, and limitations of liability set forth
